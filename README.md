TraerPhysicsCPP
===============

This is the C++ port of the Traer Physics Library by Jeff. The original processing library can be obtained from http://murderandcreate.com/physics/. 

Project Dependencies
====================
The project requires two libraries
1) Freeglut (latest version)
   As of this writing, the latest freeglut version is v 2.8.1 which may be obtained from http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php#download
2) glm maths library (latest version)
   As of this writing, the latest glm version is v 0.9.5.3 which may be obtained from http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.5/index.html. I used v 0.9.4.6 but the code should run without a problem with the latest glm library.
   
Compiling the library
=====================

Open the VisualStudio 2012 project file TraerPhysics.sln in the TraerPhysics folder on the root. Compile and run and it should compile and run fine. Demo projects are available in the Demos directory.

That's it Enjoy !!!
